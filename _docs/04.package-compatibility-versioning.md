## üßπ Using Knip

[Knip](https://knip.dev/)

### Initial Setup

1. **Installation**:

    ```bash
    npm init @knip/config
    ```

2. **Add to Package Scripts**:

    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "knip": "knip"
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Create Configuration File**:
   Create a `.knip.json` in your project root:
    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/knip@latest/schema.json",
        "entry": ["src/index.ts", "src/components/*/index.ts"],
        "project": [
            "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",
            "!src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
        ],
        "ignoreDependencies": [
            // Testing libraries that might be used dynamically
            "jest",
            "@testing-library/*",
            // Build tools that might not have direct imports
            "typescript",
            "eslint*",
            "prettier"
        ],
        "ignoreBinaries": ["ts-node"]
    }
    ```

### Running Knip

Run Knip anytime with:

```bash
npm run knip
```

This analyzes your project for:

- Unused dependencies in `package.json`
- Unresolved imports
- Unused files
- Unused exports (functions, variables, types)

### Understanding Results

Knip's output includes several sections:

1. **Unused Dependencies**:
   Packages listed in your `package.json` but not imported anywhere.

2. **Unused Dev Dependencies**:
   Development dependencies that aren't used in your project.

3. **Unresolved Imports**:
   Imports that can't be resolved to files or packages.

4. **Unused Files**:
   Files not imported or used as entry points.

5. **Unused Exports**:
   Exported values never imported elsewhere.

### Targeted Analysis

Knip supports more specific checks with flags:

```bash
# Only check dependencies
npm run knip -- --dependencies

# Only check for unused files
npm run knip -- --unused-files

# Only check for unused exports
npm run knip -- --unused-exports

# List production dependencies
npm run knip -- --production

# Include type dependencies in the analysis
npm run knip -- --types
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Add Knip to your CI workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality.yml
name: Quality Checks

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
    dependencies-check:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
              with:
                  node-version: 18
            - run: npm ci
            - name: Check for unused dependencies
              run: npm run knip
```

### Best Practices with Knip

1. **Regular Maintenance**:

    - Run Knip before releases to ensure clean dependencies
    - Schedule periodic cleanup tasks in your development workflow

2. **Work with Server Components**:

    - When using Next.js server components, adjust the configuration to recognize imports from React Server Components:

    ```json
    {
        "ignoreDependencies": [
            // Server component dependencies might not be directly imported
            "next",
            "react",
            "react-dom"
        ]
    }
    ```

3. **Custom Rules for Feature-Based Architecture**:

    - Configure entry points by feature domain rather than technical type
    - Ensure each domain has a clean export pattern

4. **Clean Up Before Merges**:

    - Always run Knip before merging feature branches
    - Address unused code before it becomes part of the main codebase

5. **Handling Dynamic Imports**:
   For dynamic imports or code splitting scenarios:
    ```json
    {
        "entry": [
            // Include dynamically imported files
            "src/features/*/lazy-components.ts"
        ]
    }
    ```

### Maintaining the Configuration

As your project evolves, adjust the `.knip.json` configuration file to accommodate:

- New patterns or dependencies
- Changes in build tools or testing frameworks
- Feature-based architecture adjustments
- Integration with server components

The current configuration is optimized for a UI component library structure using React, but you can modify it as needed for your specific architecture.

Keep this toolkit handy to keep your project lean, up-to-date, and secure. For best results, integrate several of these into your regular development workflow or CI/CD pipelines.
